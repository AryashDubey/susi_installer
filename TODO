- install youtube_dl on buster and above?

- desktop file for menu item to start susi_linux
- make susi-server systemd socket activated so that
  starting susi_linux starts susi-server automatically
- ApplicationIcon for susi-linux
  example code maybe https://github.com/bluppfisk/coinprice-indicator/blob/master/coin/indicator.py
- write desktop installation guide

- current master branch is broken, susi server answers rubbish!


- Fedora does not have lsb_release, check for /etc/redhat-release:
	Fedora release 31 (Thirty One)
  do the same for Debian?
