- npm/node installation!!!!
-
- install youtube_dl on buster and above?

- make susi-server systemd socket activated so that
  starting susi_linux starts susi-server automatically
- ApplicationIcon for susi-linux
  example code maybe https://github.com/bluppfisk/coinprice-indicator/blob/master/coin/indicator.py

- current master branch is broken, susi server answers rubbish!

- Python3.6 modules!!! Linux Mint current runs on Py3.6

- snowboy library check: too many libraries are linked, and thus
  installation on Fedora etc is broken since the libraries are
  named differently. I guess **only** cblas needs to be linked,
  at least this is what my trials showed.
